## Information
Simply Weather is a Python-based web application built using the Flask library. It is designed to show the current weather of any city that the user adds. This is done thanks to OpenWeatherMap's Weather API. The purpose was to create a full stack project while improving my skills in using APIs.

If I were to do it differently, I would add a database (possibly using SQLAlchemy) and host it on a website.

## Features
Simply Weather offers the following features:

- View the current temperature and weather of a city, sourced from OpenWeatherMap.

- Add cities by name to keep track of their weather
