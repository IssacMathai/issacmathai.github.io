## Information
Temperature Converter is a tool that facilitates conversions between metres and feet as well as centimetres and inches. 

This was created over the course of three months for a Year 13 Digital Technologies internal assessment. 

The code is structured around each GUI window having its own class. This allowed for readability and simpler bug fixing as each section was modularised.

My biggest challenge while developing this was making sure that the user couldn't keep clicking buttons in windows 'underneath' the user's current window. 

Next time, I would allow the user to freely convert between any of the four different units. In hindsight, only allowing the user to convert between centimetres and inches or metres and feet was a very arbitrary choice.
