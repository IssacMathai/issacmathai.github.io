## Information
Tippa is a decentralised app on the secret network blockchain that allows content creators to receive tips securely and privately with virtually no transaction fees. It interfaces with the Keplr wallet to easily allow for sending funds.

I created Tippa for the final assignment of my Decentralised Web Applications course and got an A-. If I were to improve on it, I would allow creators to set options for different tiers of donations. For example, the options could be 1 SCRT, 5 SCRT and 10 SCRT or a custom amount. This would make donating more accessible for fans.

## Features
- Create a tip jar for your wallet address
- Interfaces with the Keplr wallet
- Full transparency - the total tips for each creator's tip jar is visible.
