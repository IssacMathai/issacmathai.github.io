## Information
Mystery Box Game was created for my Digital Technologies class while in Year 13 of high school. We had 3 weeks worth of classes to create this game with the purpose of learning more advanced python as well as how to use tkinter to create GUI windows with text and images.

The plan for writing the code was to let each GUI window has its own class. This simple structure helped with readability and bug fixing as I immediately knew which section of the code to look at.

If I were to do it over again, I would make the game more fair and make it possible to win while also allowing the player to put more money in. This game was based around an 'anti-gambling' theme and so it was intentionally designed to be unfair to dissuade players from practicing gambling in real life, leading to some limitations.
