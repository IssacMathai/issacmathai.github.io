## Information
Temperature Converter is a tool that facilitates conversions between degrees centrigrade and fahrenheit. 
It was created for my Digital Technologies class while in Year 13 over the course of a month.

The purpose was to learn how to use python and tkinter to create a functional temperature converter contained in user-friendly GUI windows.

The code is structured around each GUI window having its own class. This allowed for simpler bug fixing as each section was modularised as well as overall readability.

After creating this, I moved on to creating MysteryBoxGame to further improve my skills with Python and Tkinter.

If I were to do it over again, I would create a more elegant UI that appears more professional, perhaps by using PyQt or some other alternative.
